      list of files to generate.
      one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
       supported query string options:
      - palette:      A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
      - color_snake:  Color of the snake
      - color_dots:   Coma separated list of dots color. 
                      The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
                      Exactly 5 colors are expected.
      example:
        outputs: |
          dark.svg?palette=github-dark&color_snake=blue
          light.svg?color_snake=#7845ab
          ocean.gif?color_snake=orange&color_dots=#bfd6f6,#8dbdff,#64a1f4,#4b91f1,#3c7dd9
